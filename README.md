# üñºÔ∏è My Image Gallery

Welcome to **My Image Gallery**‚Äîa project where I individually designed and developed a sleek, interactive gallery showcasing images across various categories: **Smart Gadgets**, **Wallpapers**, and **Furniture**. This gallery is responsive and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless browsing experience.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

The gallery features four main sections:

### **All Images**: Browse the entire collection in one place.

To enhance user interaction, a **"View More"** button is available in each category:

This feature ensures users can explore more content at their pace without overwhelming them upfront.
